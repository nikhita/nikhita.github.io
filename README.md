## Source code of my blog

The site is available at - https://nikhita.github.io/. It has been hosted using Github pages.

Prior to building the new website, I was using the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme. I have written two detailed tutorials about how I had made the blog using Lanyon. They turned out to be quite useful while rebuilding the site! Here they are for your quick reference:

* [How to build a blog using Github, Jekyll and Lanyon](https://nikhita.github.io/build-blog-using-github-jekyll)
* [SEO for Jekyll blogs](https://nikhita.github.io/build-blog-using-github-jekyll) - if you have a jekyll blog, definitely read this!
