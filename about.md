<br>


I am Nikhita Raghunath, an undergraduate from VJTI, Mumbai. I am a Google Summer of Code intern for Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) working on the Kubernetes project. You can know more about my GSoC work [here](https://github.com/nikhita/gsoc-meta-k8s).

I am interested in backend applications, distributed systems, and Linux. I like programming in Go, C++, C and Python. I firmly believe that software development is much more than code - itâ€™s about building a diverse and inclusive community too.

I write at my blog - if you have questions, suggestions or just anything to say, please contact me!

You can find me at these places. Feel free to reach out (especially if you like nerdy jokes!).
